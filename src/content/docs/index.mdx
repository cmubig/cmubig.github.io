    We are a research group in the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute</a> 
    at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. 
    Our goal is to create robots that can co-exist and collaborate with humans in shared environments, 
    continuously learning to improve themselves over time through training, exploration, and interaction. 
    We are broadly focused on topics at the intersection of vision, language, and planning in robotics.
